# How to create and submit a new proposal

1. **First, find out if a proposal for this idea already exists.**
1. **If a proposal doesn't exist, it's time to create one.** Here are the steps:
    1. **Create a new branch.** Create a new branch for the proposal named: `[your initials]-component-[proposed component name]`. For example, if Jane Doe was creating a proposal for a loader component, the branch would be named `jd-component-loader`.
    1. **Create a new proposal file.** In your new branch, create a file in the `/proposals` directory called `component-[component name].md`. For example, `component-loader.md`.
    1. **Copy the proposal template.** Copy the contents of [_proposal-template.md](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-proposals/tree/main/proposals/_proposal-template.md) into this file.
    1. **Fill out the template.** All fields that aren't marked as "Optional" must be completed before the proposal can be considered for USWDS.
    1. **Open a pull request.** Open a pull request (PR) with the title: `Proposal: [Component name]`. For example, `Component proposal: Loader`.
    1. **Share updates with the community.** Add a comment to the related component discussion when the proposal is started and another comment when the proposal is completed and open for final comment. Use the [uswds-public Slack channel](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C3F14AHSQ) to announce when proposals are open for voting.
